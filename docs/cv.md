# Ideas for CV

- The main benefit of the website is that I can go into more detail than a resume
- Close secondary benefit is that I can show off my skills while doing so

## General

- I want to quickly give people a top line blurb for each topic and let them deep dive into the details if they want.
  - The deep dive can be a project showcase or thought piece. I want to control their experience and guide them through what I want to tell them
- I want to steer people away from the typical CV format. They likely already have a PDF of my CV, so I don't need to restate it. I can probably have it burried somewhere for completeness sake, but the main focus needs to be on projects, thought pieces, and blogs.
- Should I list out skills? I think a show, don't tell approach is better. List out technologies and tools in the projects as a sidebar to hit key words, but don't have a dedicated section for it.
- I do still need a section to describe who I am though and give people an overview. Focus probably needs to be on "a technical leader that can drive initiatives from both a people/planning side and an implementation side". Need less corporate language for that though. People should feel excited about working with me.
- **Need to strike a balance between quickly giving information and letting people deep dive into details. Many won't want to immediately read some long blog post about a project, but if the showcase can quickly list off key technologies and has a great hook above the fold, they're more likely to stay and read it all.**

## Projects

- How should project showcases relate to project blogs? For some projects, there might be multiple blogs, but I should have a single showcase to serve as the nexus for all the content related to the project.

  - If I do that, then it should probably start with an overview of the project, including media. The overview should be brief, but give a good sense of what the project is. Details should exist in the project blogs and the project showcase should link to those.

- Project Showcases
  - Homelab. Subprojects (if that makes sense)
    - k8s setup (including NAS, ArgoCD, cert-manager, etc.)
    - GitLab + Argo Workflows
    - DNS
    - Power outage management
  - Personal Website
  - MeatNet
  - Work. This is a place to showcase the things I've done professionally.
    - CI/CD work Include AgF and TBOL.
      - Possible thought piece on what made the initiative successful. More focus on people and less on technical solution.
    - Automated Testing. Focus on architecture and project implementation, less on technical details or writing tests. Goal here is to show how I drove an initiative forward and delivered results.
