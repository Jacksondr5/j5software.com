# General Ideas

## Design

- I'm probably going to want to rely heavily on AI art generation for cases where I don't have a good image to use. But, it shouldn't be a jarring difference between that and my real photos. Need to figure out how to do that.

## Animations

- Animations for page transitions in general are going to probably require being synced with the navigation UI/UX.
  - Need to be impressive, but not get in people's way of navigating around the site. So, they need to be fast.

## Testing

- E2E
  - Make sure all the links on my blogs go somewhere. Need some way to find every page. Does using/verifying a sitemap make sense?
  - Make sure all the images load
- Visual Regression
  - Sample blog page with all the different components
