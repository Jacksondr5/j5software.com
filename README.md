- [ ] Create wireframes
- [ ] Decide on "design system"
- [ ] Figure out how to link everything together so people are brought to other areas of the site
- [ ] Redirect j5software.com to the deployed Vercel site (go live)
- [ ] Figure out image hosting solution. IIRC, Theo made a comment once about how `/public` is not a great place to store images. And it does make sense that over time, I probably don't want a ton of images in the repo. Not sure if UploadThing or some other solution is the way to go.
